-- First definition of a group: List(A + A) / R. Some oddity:
-- 1) f : A → A → Bool is an equality predicate (Eq in Haskell), but I'm not sure how to
--    insist that (f a₁ a₂ = true) ≅ (a₁ = a₂) or just say "if the identity type is
--    inhabited." Also encode-decode seems to use information from the type, so defining
--    f should be a reasonable requirement (it's just code, but using true for 𝟙 and false
--    for 𝟘).
-- 2) I promise it terminates. Otherwise it insists that the first recursive call is
--    uncertain but the list is clearly one element shorter.
-- 3) I think the warning isn't all that important (but I'm a programmer, don't trust me).
--    My understanding is that the warning means "the definitional equalities Agda has can
--    be surprising" but I don't see how it's bad yet.
